# mysqlbackup.pl v1.0 dale a/t bewley.net 04/22/2000

Script to backup all local mysql databases.

Based on ideas from:
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/snippets.html#Mysql_Backup_and_Restore_Scripts
 http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mysqlsnapshot/

What this script does:
 1. Obtain a list of databases
 2. Dump all the databases into a separate dump files (these dump files
    are ready for DB restore)
 3. Backup the last update log file and create a new log file
    Is this the safest way to do that???

Todo:
 o No need to do a full dump each time, add a switch to only rotate the update log.
 o Log actions
 o Add support for a config file.
 o All the basics are fine and stable, but I haven't revisited the transaction
   log rotation for quite a while.
