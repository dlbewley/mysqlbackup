Script to backup mysql databases.

Based on ideas from:
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/snippets.html#Mysql_Backup_and_Restore_Scripts
 http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mysqlsnapshot/

What this script does:
 1. Obtain a list of databases
 2. Dump all the databases into a separate dump files (these dump files
    are ready for DB restore)
 3. Backup the last update log file and create a new log file
    Is this the safest way to do that???

Usage:
 Edit default options in /etc/mysqlbackup/mysqlbackup.cfg.
 Add mysql root user credentions to /etc/mysqlbackup/my.cnf.
 Test the script by hand 'mysqlbackup -h'.
 Wait for cronjob to fire in the morning.
 
Todo:
 o No need to do a full dump each time, add a switch to only rotate the update log.
 o Log actions
 o All the basics are fine and stable, but I haven't revisited the transaction
   log rotation for quite a while.
 o Cronjob removes backups over 14 days. Add switch to mysqlbackup for purging
   and move retention period to the config file.
 o Run as non-root
 o Some executable locations were hard coded because this bounced around on a solaris
   box for a while. Clean that up, and just use the path.
 o The my.cnf is required by the dump command. So, command line user/pass is ignored.
